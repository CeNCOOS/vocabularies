Platform Vocabulary

## Introduction

The [IOOS Platform Vocabulary](http://mmisw.org/orr/#http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/platform) is a controlled vocabulary for platform types with definitions, references used for the definition, and links to example images. It is registered at [MMI-ORR](http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/platform). It provides oceanographic data users consistent terminology to describe a wide array of different platform types from which sensors are attached and data sets collected.

By mapping the terms within this one vocabulary, a simple hierarchy of terms is provided. The list of IOOS Platform types was mapped hierarchically by using simple relationships between the terms within the vocabulary to identify general platform types. This was done by using the MMI-ORR Mapping Tool. By using this method some of the specific types of platforms can be members of more than one general type where one-to-many relationships are warranted. For example, a profiling_buoy can be a buoy platform type but also can be a profiler platform type.

As part of developing the IOOS Platform Vocabulary it was important to identify what are valid terms for the vocabulary and identify what we mean by an asset, platform, sensor(s) and station. The following definitions helped to refine what terms should go in the IOOS Platform Vocabulary.
